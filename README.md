# 01 Refactor for Horiseon Website

## Description

The Horiseon Marketing Website is the central hub for information on the marketing services Horiseon provides. The website needed updating to meet accessibility criteria. This was implemented through updating semantic HTML elements and adding alt elements for all images. Meta tags were also added to increase SEO rankings.


Headings were updated to follow the correct order, CSS was consolidated, and comments were added in both the stylsheet and index.
